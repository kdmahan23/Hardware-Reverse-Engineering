## Collaboration Statement

## Summary
The purpose of this lab was to introduce students to electronic measurement equipment. The students will learn how to use a multimeter, oscilloscope, function generator, and logical analyzer.

### Equipment Used
- 9 Volt battery
- Assorted Resistors
- Multimeter
- Oscilloscope
- Saleae Logic Analyzer
- Function Generator

### Part 1 - Multimeter
**Q1: What is the voltage across the 9V battery?**  
- 8.66V

**Q2: What are the color bands of the two resistors you chose, and what are their ideal resistances including their tolerance?**
- Yellow → purple → gold → gold
~ 4.7 Ω  +/-5% tolerance
- Brown → red → gold → gold
~ 1.2 Ω  +/- 5% tolerance

**Q3: What are the actual measured resistances of the two resistors?**
- Yellow → purple → gold → gold
~ 4.7 Ω 
- Brown → red → gold → gold
~ 1.2 Ω

### Part 2 - Oscilloscope

#### Subpart 1
**Q4: What is the estimated amplitude of the oscilloscope's test signal? Include picture**  
- 4V

#### Subpart 2 - Measuring Sine Wave Signal
**Q5: What is the exact amplitude of the sine wave measured on the oscilloscope? Include picture.**  
- 1.08125V

**Q6: What is the exact period of the sine wave measured on the oscilloscope? If converted into its corresponding frequency, does this match the output frequency set on the function generator? Include Picture.**  
- 201us
- When converted, the period, corresponds to approximately 5 kHz.

**Q8: What is the exact period of the square wave measured on the oscilloscope? If converted into its corresponding frequency, does this match the output frequency set on the function generator? Include square-ish picture.**
- 1.25ms
- When converted, the period, corresponds to 800Hz.

**Q9: What is the measured rise time of the square wave? Include Picture.**
- 37.9ns

## Conclusion
I have a much better understanding of the equipment we will be using in other labs. I strugged the most with O-scope and function generator. This was because there are many different details you need to pay attention to for the machines to work correctly.
